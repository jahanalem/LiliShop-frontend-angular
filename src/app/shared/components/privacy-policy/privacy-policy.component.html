  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>
    Welcome to <strong>LiliShop</strong>. Please note that this website is currently in a testing and
    development phase. The purpose of this site is to evaluate its functionality, gather feedback, and make
    improvements before the official launch. As such, all data, including user interactions and purchases, are
    simulated and not real.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Collection</h2>
  <p>
    During this testing phase, we may collect the following types of data:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Fake Personal Information:</strong> Any personal information you provide, such as your name, email address, and payment details, is considered fake or simulated data for testing purposes only.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We collect non-personal data related to how you use and interact with the website. This may include your IP address, browser type, and browsing behavior on the site.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Use of Data</h2>
  <p>
    The data collected during this phase is used exclusively for:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Testing the functionality of our website.</li>
    <li>Identifying and fixing bugs or issues.</li>
    <li>Improving the user experience based on feedback.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>No Real Transactions</h2>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    We may use third-party services, such as analytics tools, to help us understand how our website is performing.
    These services may collect anonymized data about your use of the site. However, since all user data is simulated,
    no real personal information is shared with these services.
  </p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>
    Even though the website is in a testing phase, we take the security of our platform seriously. We employ
    reasonable measures to protect the data we collect during this phase, but please be aware that this site is not
    intended for real user interactions.
